# QueryDelegator

Write composable and table agnostic query objects for ActiveRecord scopes. Move query code from ActiveRecord models to query objects, because database query code do not belong in the model.

## Installation

QueryDelegator works with Rails 5.1.7 onwards. Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'query_delegator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install query_delegator

## Usage

Query objects inherit from `QueryDelegator` class, they typically live under `app/queries` directory.
Naming convention suggests adding a `Query` suffix to query object class names.
Alternatively prefixing class names with words like `By` is shorter and reads more naturally.

```ruby
class ByEmail < QueryDelegator
  def call(email)
    at(email).first
  end

  def at(email)
    where(email: email.to_s.downcase)
  end

  def be(email)
    return all unless email.blank?

    at email
  end
end
```

Wrap scopes outside ActiveRecord models.

```ruby
@user = ByEmail.new(User).("john.doe@example.test")
@contacts = @user.contacts.then(&ByEmail).be(params[:email])
```

Wrap scopes inside ActiveRecord models.

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :contacts
  scope :by_email, ByEmail
end

class Contact < ApplicationRecord
  belong_to :user
  scope :by_email, ByEmail
end

@user = User.by_email.("john.doe@example.test")
@contacts = @user.contacts.by_email.be(params[:email])
```

### QueryDelegator::[]

Delegates Active Record scope to a query object method.
Intended for association and named scopes, it accepts a query object's method name and returns a `Proc`.

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :contacts, ByCreated[:recently]
  scope :since, ByCreated[:since]
end

class ByCreated < QueryDelegator
  def recently
    order(created_at: :desc)
  end

  def since(timestamp)
    where table[:created_at].gteq(timestamp)
  end
end

@users = User.since 1.year.ago
```

### QueryDelegator::Be

To add the helper method `be`, include this module in your query object class like so:

```ruby
class ByPublished < QueryDelegator
  include Be

  def be_draft
    on nil
  end

  def be_published
    where.not(published_on: nil)
  end

  def on(date)
    where(published_on: date)
  end
end
```

#### be

Given a name, method `be` invokes another method prefixed with `be_`, otherwise
returns `none` by default or
returns `all` given a blank name.

```ruby
@books = @author.books.then(&ByPublished)
@books.be(['draft'])  # returns books without publish date
@books.be(:published) # returns books with publish date
@books.be('unknown')  # returns none
@books.be(nil)        # returns all books
```

### QueryDelegator::MemoryFetching

Provides convenient methods intended to retrieve loaded records from memory,
instead of running queries from the database.
Include this module in your query object classes like so:

```ruby
class ByColor < QueryDelegator
  include MemoryFetching

  def fetch_by_color(color)
    fetch -> { |by| by.color == color }
  end
end

ByEmail.include QueryDelegator::MemoryFetching
```

#### fetch

This helper method retrieves the first record that meets the condition, otherwise
returns either the given block value or the optional default value which is `nil`.

```ruby
@vehicles = Vehicle.then(&ByColor)
@vehicles.fetch_by_color 'red'                               # returns a red Vehicle record
@vehicles.fetch(-> v { v.color == 'gold'}                    # returns nil
@vehicles.fetch(proc { |v| v.color == 'gold'}, NoVehicle)    # returns NoVehicle
@vehicles.fetch(proc { |v| v.color == 'gold'}) { NoVehicle } # returns NoVehicle
@vehicles.fetch(Car)                                         # returns a Car record
```

#### fetch_or_new

This method also [fetches](#fetch) a record that meets the condition, otherwise loads a new record with `Hash` from the argument condition.
Given a block, it instead fetches a record that meets the block condition.

```ruby
class HasEmailOrPhone < SimpleDelegator
  def ===(contact)
    contact.email == email || contact.phone == phone
  end

  def to_h
    { full_name: full_name, email: email, phone: phone }
  end
end

@user_contacts = ByEmail.new(@user.contacts)

# Returns a Contact with the same customer name or email.
@customer_contact = @user_contacts.fetch_or_new(HasEmailOrPhone[@customer])

# Either fetch primary Contact or load a new Contact with the specified email.
@primary_contact = @user_contacts.fetch_or_new(email: "john.doe@example.test", &:primary?)
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
